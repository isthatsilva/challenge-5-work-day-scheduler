# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

As a busy person, I want to have a planner that I can schedule different tasks by the hour. I want to see the date of the day and hourly time slots that switches colors between past, present, and future times. The past time will be in gray. current time in red, and future time in green. I want to also add information into the blocks and save that information after I refresh the page.
